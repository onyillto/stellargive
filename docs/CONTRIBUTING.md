# Contributing to stellarGive

Thanks for contributing to stellarGive. This repository contains:
- Soroban contract: `contracts/stellar-give`
- Next.js frontend: `frontend`

## 1. Branch Strategy

Use prefixed branch names:
- `feat/<short-description>` for features
- `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
- `chore/<short-description>` for maintenance

Examples:
- `feat/campaign-filtering`
- `fix/claim-deadline-validation`
- `chore/ci-cache-tuning`

## 2. Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Feyisara2108/stellargive.git
cd stellargive
cp .env.example .env
```

See `examples/` for CLI interaction patterns and Soroban integration examples.

Contract tooling:
```bash
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Frontend tooling:
```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
```

## 3. Testing Requirements

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
# Contract checks
cd contracts/stellar-give
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Frontend checks
cd ../../frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## 4. Code Review Standards

- Keep PRs focused and scoped to a single concern.
- Include tests or rationale when changing contract logic.
- Do not merge with failing CI.
- Document config/deployment changes in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Flag security-sensitive changes explicitly in PR description.

## 5. Commit Message Convention

Use Conventional Commits:
- `feat: add campaign claim guard`
- `fix: enforce accepted token check`
- `chore: optimize frontend ci cache`

## 6. Gas Estimation Guidelines

Every new contract function added to the project must be checked for resource
usage.  The goal is to keep individual transactions affordable for end users.

**Targets:**
| Operation | Expected fee (stroops) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `create_campaign` | < 200 000 |
| `donate` | < 300 000 |
| `claim_funds` | < 300 000 |
| Any new function | < 500 000 |

**How to measure:**
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --simulate-only \
  -- <function_name> [args...]
```
The `minResourceFee` field in the simulation response shows the fee in stroops.

**Frontend guard:**
`submitTransaction` in `src/lib/soroban.ts` will log a warning and trigger a
`GasWarning` UI banner when the simulated fee exceeds `MAX_SIMULATION_FEE_STROOPS`
(10 M stroops).  If your new function consistently triggers this warning, reduce
its resource usage before merging.

## 7. Component Storybook

The frontend ships with a Storybook for visual review of shared components
(`Button`, `Progress`, `CampaignCard`, `DonateModal`, ...). Use it whenever
you change a component to confirm light/dark rendering and mobile layout
before opening a PR.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install           # one-time, picks up @storybook/* devDeps
npm run storybook     # serves at http://localhost:6006
npm run build-storybook   # produces a static bundle under storybook-static/
```

Story conventions:
- Co-locate `*.stories.tsx` next to the component it documents.
- Cover at least the primary state, an "edge" state (loading / error /
  empty), and one mobile viewport variant.
- Shared mock data lives in [`frontend/src/stories/mocks.ts`](../frontend/src/stories/mocks.ts).
- Use the theme toolbar to confirm dark-mode rendering — both themes share
  the variables defined in [`frontend/src/app/globals.css`](../frontend/src/app/globals.css).

A hosted Storybook URL will be added here once the team picks a host
(Vercel or Chromatic) and the deploy workflow lands.

## Regenerating TypeScript contract bindings

The frontend talks to the Soroban contract through generated TypeScript bindings.
**After any change to the contract's interface, regenerate them so the frontend
types stay in sync** (this prevents silent drift between contract and UI).

Prerequisites: the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli)
installed and the contract built to WASM
(`cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` in `contracts/stellar-give`).

```bash
cd frontend
npm run generate:bindings
```

This runs `stellar contract bindings typescript` against
`contracts/stellar-give/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_give.wasm`
and writes the bindings to `frontend/src/lib/bindings/`.

> The step is intentionally **not** part of `npm run build`: production/CI builds
> of the frontend don't have the Stellar CLI or the compiled WASM available, so
> wiring it into `build` would break those pipelines. Run it locally (or in a
> contract-aware CI job) whenever the contract interface changes.
